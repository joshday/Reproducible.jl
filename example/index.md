[**Reproducible.jl**](https://github.com/joshday/Reproducible.jl) is a lightweight Julia package for creating reproducible reports. 

The process:

1. Write Markdown
2. Generate Markdown (with *rendered* code blocks)

**Reproducible** treats code blocks in the source document according to a *renderer*,
but simply copies over all other parts of the source.
The basic syntax for a **Reproducible** code block is

````
```julia; <renderer>
x = 1
```
````

If you are already familiar with the fantastic [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) 
package, think of **Reproducible** as a more customizable way to write `@example`, `@repl`, etc. blocks.

# Usage

To render the code blocks in a `source` file, use the `Reproducible.build` function:

`Reproducible.build(source, <builddir>; frontmatter="", toc=false)`

Note that **Reproducible** uses Julia's `Markdown` package in the standard library, which does not parse
YAML frontmatter, e.g.

```
---
title: Introduction
author: Josh Day
---
```

To work around this, `frontmatter` can be passed as a keyword argument to `build` e.g.
`build(src; frontmatter = "title:Introduction\nauthor:Josh Day")`

# Built-in Renderers

Renderers are meant to be customizable (see the [Renderers](renderers.md) section), but there are some
built into **Reproducible**:

- `run`: Run the block and insert the source code.
```julia; run;
x = "This is rendered via `julia; run;`"
```

- `hide`: Run the block, but hide the source code.
```julia; hide;
x = "This is rendered via `julia; hide;`"
```

- `block`: Run the block and insert the source code and output of the last line.
```julia; block;
x = "This is rendered via `julia; block;`"
```

- `repl`: Treat block as if it were entered into the Julia REPL.
```julia; repl;
x = "This is rendered via `julia; repl;`"
```

# Markdown

Reproducible uses Julia's standard library `Markdown` package to parse a markdown file, so any 
valid markdown syntax is fair game.  

| Here | is | a | table |
|------|----|---|-------|
| A    | B  | C | D     |

- Here
- is
- a
- list

```julia
# here is some julia code with syntax highlighting

f(x) = x ^ 2

mutable struct MyStruct
    a::Int
end
```

# Code Blocks of Other Languages

Other languages will be left alone, but there's no reason the approach of **Reproducible**
could not be extended via [PyCall](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl), 
[RCall](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl), etc.

- Input file:
````
```python
import pandas as pd
```
````
- Output file:
  
```python
import pandas as pd
```

# Custom Renderers

**Reproducible** creates a `CodeBlock` object from markdown code blocks (see `?CodeBlock` and `?CodeRow`).

To create a custom renderer so that you can use 

````
```julia; myrenderer; ky1 = true, ky2 = 10
...
```
````

you should overload

```julia
Reproducible.render(o::CodeBlock, r::Val{:myrenderer}; ky1=true, ky2=1, kw...)
```

which should return the String that you wish to be inserted into the output document.

## Custom Renderer Example

Check the examples/make.jl file!  Now we can do

````
```julia;thing;
1 + 1
2 + 2
```
````

the output would look like:

```julia; thing;
1 + 1
2 + 2
```

# Render Tests

## Test 1

```julia; testall;
x = 1

y = 2
```

## Test 2

```julia; testall;
x = 1;

y = 2
```

## Test 3

```julia; testall;
randn(3,3)
```
